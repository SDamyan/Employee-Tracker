# Employee Tracker
This is an interface created to make it easier for non-developers to view and manipulate employee information stored in a database.  Node, inquirer, and MySQL were used.  The user (or business owner) will be able to view and add to all three tables (department, role, and employee), as well as update the department table.  This way the user can better organize their business.
